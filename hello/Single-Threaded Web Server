 Summary of Single-Threaded Web Server Code

This Rust program creates a simple, single-threaded web server that listens for incoming TCP connections on port 8080. It operates as follows:

1. TCP Listener Initialization: The server binds to the local address `127.0.0.1:8080` and listens for incoming TCP connections. The `TcpListener` from Rust’s standard library is used to establish this listener.

2. Handling Incoming Connections: For each incoming connection, the server attempts to read an HTTP request from the client. It reads the raw bytes from the TCP stream and stores them in a buffer.

3. HTTP Response: After receiving a client request, the server responds with a basic HTTP response. The response includes:
   - An HTTP status code `200 OK`, indicating a successful request.
   - A content type of `text/html`.
   - A simple HTML body with "Hello, World!" as the message.

4. Error Handling: The server uses `match` statements to handle possible errors:
   - If a connection fails, an error message is printed.
   - If writing the response fails, it reports a failure to send the response.

5. Single-Threaded Execution: The server handles one connection at a time sequentially, making it a single-threaded server. This approach is suitable for basic use cases and demonstrates the essentials of request-response handling in a web server.
